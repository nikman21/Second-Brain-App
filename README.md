Second Brain App


Purpose
I created this app because I've been searching for a productivity tool that truly meets my needs. I've tried using Notion and Obsidian for note-taking, and while they have their strengths, I felt they were missing some important functionalities. As I researched the concept of building a "second brain" within these apps, I realized I wanted the best of both worlds.

Tech Stack
Front-end:

TypeScript for client-side scripting and interactivity.
React for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS for easy styling of UI components.
Redux for managing the application state.
Back-end:

Next.js for server-side rendering and backend development.
Database:

MongoDB with Mongoose and Typegoose for storing and retrieving data.
Authentication:

Bcrypt for secure password handling.
Next-Auth for authentication capabilities.
I wanted to combine the customizability and functionality of Notion with the simplicity and graph view of Obsidian. By using this tech stack, I'm building the ultimate productivity app that will provide a seamless and powerful experience for users like myself.
